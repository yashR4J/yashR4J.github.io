  description: Co-authored a study investigating automated speaker verification systems using a TDNN model. 
  Proposed improvements to existing DNN speaker recognition systems by utilising Speechbrainâ€™s modular framework to 
  compare the accuracies of different experimental setups in reducing validation error. Developed a frontend interface 
  to demonstrate project outcomes and placed in the top 3 teams in the cohort.
